# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is sha256, but md5, sha1, sha224, sha384 and
# sha512 are also supported.
#
# WARNING: While md5 and sha1 are also supported, do not use them due to the
# high chance of possible collisions and thus security breach.
#
# Prior to changing this value, the master should be stopped and all Salt
# caches should be cleared.

#####         Logging settings       #####
##########################################
# The location of the minion log file
# The minion log can be sent to a regular file, local path name, or network
# location. Remote logging works best when configured to use rsyslogd(8) (e.g.:
# ``file:///dev/log``), with rsyslogd(8) configured for network logging. The URI
# format is: <file|udp|tcp>://<host|socketpath>:<port-if-required>/<log-facility>
log_file: file:///dev/log

# The level of messages to send to the console.
# One of 'garbage', 'trace', 'debug', info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical'.
#
# The following log levels are considered INSECURE and may log sensitive data:
# ['garbage', 'trace', 'debug']
#
# Default: 'warning'
log_level: {{ log_level }}

# Set the location of the salt master server, if the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.

# The user to run salt

# The directory to store the pki information in
pki_dir: /config/salt/pki/minion

# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
